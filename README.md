# Pong

Created from a Javascript tutorial, This is a re-creation of the classic game Pong.

I couldn't resist, it was the first video game I have ever played on an Atari console hooked up to a black & white television.

Using concepts such as Canvas API to generate the 2d objects and
event listeners to keep track of ball and paddle movements to then constantly re-draw canvas.
The AI simply moves a paddle in relation to the ball position, but purposely lags a little to create easier player wins.

This is a work in progress. I would like to implement the following features to more closely resemble the Atari version.

### Future features marked if implemented:

- [ ]  Sound
- [ ]  Paddle Toggle (Smaller paddle to increase difficulty)
- [ ]  AI Speed ( Difficulty check boxes to increase AI accuracy )

#### Built with:

 - Javascript
 - HTML
 - CSS
